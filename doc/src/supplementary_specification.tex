\section{Introduction}
In Unified Process methodology, the document \emph{Supplementary Specification} contains all the non-functional requirements. (The functional requirements are specified with \emph{Use Cases}.)

Some additional non-functional requirements are currently covered in the Vision Document.

\section{Non-functional requirements}

\subsection{Usability}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[U1] Avoid colors associated with common forms of color blindness.
	\item[U2] The interface should be as intuitive as possible.
	\item[U3] The key mapping should be customizable.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reliability}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[R1] When the application is closed unexpectedly the data integrity should not be harmed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[P1] The application should run on entry-level computer with over 30 frames per second.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supportability}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[S1] The system has to run on Unix/GNU-Linux as well as on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.	
\end{itemize}

\section{Technical specifications}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[T1] Java 6 is used.
	\item[T2] The cross-platform game development library libgdx (http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/) is used. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Tools}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Eclipse version "Juno" for java development (http://www.eclipse.org)
	\item redmine version 2.1 for issue tracking and time reporting (http://www.redmine.org)
	\item git hosted on github for revision control (http://www.github.com)
	\item Apache maven 2 for build automation (http://maven.apache.org)
	\item Artifactory as a repository manager (http://www.jfrog.com)
	\item Astah community for UML diagrams (http://www.astah.net)
	\item Jenkins 1.499 as a Build Server (http://jenkins-ci.org)
\end{itemize}
