\section{Non-functional requirements}

%The non-functional requirements are categorized according to the FURPS+ model, where the functional requirements are left out (see use-case model).

\subsection{Usability}



%None so far.

\subsection{Reliability}

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item[R1] The system is able to recover from monitoring device errors.
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance}

The application should 



%\begin{itemize}
%	\item[P1] The system has to handle a large number of patients. It should support at least 10'000 monitored patients a year.
%	\item[P2] Many doctors should be able to work simultaneously on the system. At least 100 registered doctors should be supported.
%	\item[P3] Search queries (i.e. look up patient's profile) should perform within the following specification: 90\% of all queries must be responded in under one second.
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supportability}

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item[S1] The system has to run on Unix/GNU-Linux as well as on Microsoft Windows.
%\end{itemize}
