\section{Introduction}
In Unified Process methodology, the document \emph{Supplementary Specification} contains all the non-functional requirements. (The functional requirements are specified with \emph{Use C	ases}.)

Some additional non-functional requirements are currently covered in the Vision Document.

\section{Non-functional requirements}

\subsection{Usability}
\begin{itemize}
\item[U1] Avoid colors associated with common forms of color blindness.
\item[U2] The interface should be as intuitive as possible.
\item[U3] The key mapping should be customizable.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Reliability}	

\subsection{Performance}

\begin{itemize}
\item[P1] The application should run on entry-level computer with over 30 frames per second.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supportability}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[S1] The system has to run on Unix/GNU-Linux as well as on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.	
	\item[S2] The system will be implemented in Java 5.
	\item[S3] The system will be implemented using the cross-platform game development library libgdx http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/. With this library a port for Android or HTML5 would be possible.
\end{itemize}
