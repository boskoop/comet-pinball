\subsection{Primary actor goals}

\begin{description}

\item[Player:] \hfill \\
A \emph{Player} uses the Comet Pinball to pass his leisure time and enjoy himself. He is interested in a well designed play field with nice visual and acoustical effects.

%\item[Administrator:] \hfill \\
%The \emph{administrator} wants to create and delete accounts for the \emph{doctor}s.

\section{Use cases (brief)}

\subsection{Player}

\begin{description}

\item[Start simulation:]   The player wants to start a game so he enters the main screen of the application and selects the option for starting a new game. The simulator loads the play field, resets the score counter and sets the right amount of available balls for this game and loads one ball in the plunger.

\item[Start game:] The plunger has to be operated to forward the ball onto the play field.  The force can be controlled by some matter.

\item[Move flippers:] The player can move the flippers to prevent the ball from leaving the play field. If the ball is hit by the flippers he follows approximately the movements of a collision.

\item[Ball leaves via drain:] The ball is passing the flippers and leaves the play field via the drain. The simulator loads a new ball in the plunger and decreases the counter of available balls by one.

\item[Extra ball:] 
to do

\item[Extra game:]
to do

\item[Gameover:] All balls have left the play field so the game is over. The score is presented to the user and the user has to start a new game to play further.

\item[Hit obstacle:] The application actualizes the score If a scoring obstacle  was hit. The ball is following the movement of a collision.

\item[Stuck ball:] The ball is stuck somewhere on the play field, so the user has the possibility to tilt the table.

\item[Tilt:] If the play field was tilted too often or too hard, the game will stop and display the user the message "Tilt".

\item[New Highscore:] If a game is over and the score has exceeded the highscore, the application will produce visual and acoustic effects. The score will be set as new highscore and the new highscore sheet is presented to the player.

\item[Watch Highscores:] 
to do

\item[Configure game properties:] The properties of the game like size of the bumpers, amount of available balls and other settings can be configured in a properties file.

\end{description}



%\item[Delete account:] A \emph{doctor} has to be deleted from the system. The account can only be deleted if it was disabled (and not enabled again) for a given period. The \emph{administrator} archives the data of the \emph{patient}s, which are referenced to this account and deletes the \emph{doctor}'s account. By deleting a \emph{doctor}'s account the system also deletes all corresponding \emph{patient} data (in the system).

%\item[Disable account:] An account of a \emph{doctor} has to be disabled. The \emph{administrator} disables the login of the \emph{doctor}. Thereby the account is also deactivated (when enabled again, the \emph{doctor} needs to reactivate the account). The system notifies the \emph{doctor} by means of an email via the \emph{email-server}. 

%\item[Enable account:] A disabled account of a \emph{doctor} has to be enabled again. The System generates a new activation code and sends it via the \emph{email-server} to the \emph{doctor}. If necessary, he also resets the \emph{doctor}'s password.

%\item[Reset password:] A \emph{doctor}'s password has to be changed. The \emph{administrator} generates a new password and gives it to the \emph{doctor} in person.

%\item[Authenticate against System:] The \emph{administrator} authenticates against the system by entering his email address and password.

%\subsection{Use Case UC1: Assign device}

%\textbf{\textsf{Scope:}} Comet Patient Monitor

%\textbf{\textsf{Level:}} user goal

%\textbf{\textsf{Primary actor:}} \emph{Doctor}

%\textbf{\textsf{Preconditions:}} \emph{Doctor} is authenticated against the system. \emph{Patient} is registered in the System.

%\textbf{\textsf{Postconditions:}} The monitoring device is assigned to the \emph{patient}. The device will monitor the temperature during a given period.

%\textbf{\textsf{Main success scenario:}}

%\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=3em]
%	\item \emph{Doctor} enters the \emph{patient}'s name and/or social security number into system.
%	\item System looks up matching \emph{patient} profiles and displays them to the \emph{doctor}.
%	\item \emph{Doctor} selects the appropriate \emph{patient} profile.
%	\item System displays detailed version of the selected profile.
%	\item \emph{Doctor} enters the device identification number into the system.
%	\item System checks if the device is already assigned to a \emph{patient}.
%	\item \emph{Doctor} enters the beginning and the end of the observation period into the system.
%	\item System verifies that the entered data is a valid observation period.
%	\item \emph{Doctor} enters the frequency by which the measures have to be performed.
%	\item System configures the device.
%	\item System saves assignment of the device to the \emph{patient}.
%\end{enumerate}

%\textbf{\textsf{Extensions:}}

%
%\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=3em]
%	\item[*a.] At any time, \emph{doctor} cancels assignment operation.
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item System discards all entered data.
%	\end{enumerate}
%	\item[2a.] No profile is found.
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item System signals error and reverts to step 1 in main scenario.
%	\end{enumerate}
%	\item[2b.] Correct \emph{patient} profile is not found.
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item \emph{Doctor} verifies entered data.
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item[1a.] \emph{Patient} is not registered (violation of precondition!):
%			\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
%				\item \emph{Doctor} cancels assignment operation and proceeds with UC4.
%			\end{enumerate}
%		\end{itemize}
%		\item \emph{Doctor} proceeds with step 1 in main scenario.
%	\end{enumerate}
%	\item[4a.] \emph{Doctor} selected wrong \emph{patient} profile.
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item \emph{Doctor} cancels assignment to selected profile.
%		\item System reverts to step 2 in main scenario.
%	\end{enumerate}
%	\item[6a.] Device is already assigned.
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item System signals error.
%		\item \emph{Doctor} gets a different device.
%		\item System reverts to step 5 in main scenario.
%	\end{enumerate}
%	\item[8a.] Invalid observation period.
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item System signals error and reverts to step 7 in main scenario.
%	\end{enumerate}
%	\item[10a.] Error while configuring the device.
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item System signals error.
%		\item \emph{Doctor} marks device as faulty and sends it to reparation.
%		\item \emph{Doctor} gets a different device.
%		\item System reverts to step 5 in main scenario.
