\section{Description}

\subsection{Classes}

\subsubsection{Game}
Each \emph{Game} has exactly one \emph{PlayField} it plays on and belongs to one \emph{Simulation}. 

\subsubsection{Obstacle}
Each \emph{Obstacle} has a type, which identifies it as a Bumper, Slingshot or alike, and a position to store it's position on the play field.

\subsubsection{Player}
The \emph{Player} is used to identify \emph{Simulation}s and \emph{Score}s in order to map them to a physical player.

\subsubsection{PlayField}
The \emph{PlayField} contains information about the physical play field on which a simulation takes place.

\subsubsection{Rule}
Each \emph{PlayField} has a certain amount of \emph{Rule}s which describe how the \emph{Player} will get \emph{Score}s for hitting \emph{Obstacle}s.

\subsubsection{Score}
The \emph{Score} keeps tracks of the points the \emph{Player} scored.

\subsubsection{Simulation}
A \emph{Simulation} is a self-contained process and consists a fixed amount of \emph{Game}s in which the \emph{Player} can achieve a \emph{Score}.
