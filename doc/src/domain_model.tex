\section{Description}

\subsection{Classes}

\subsubsection{Ball}
Each \emph{Ball} has it's Position, which is used to store its position on the play field.

\subsubsection{Game}
Each \emph{Game} has exactly one \emph{PlayField} it plays on and belongs to one \emph{Simulation} while having multiple \emph{Ball}s. 

\subsubsection{Obstacle}
Each \emph{Obstacle} has a type, which identifies it as a Bumper, Slingshot or alike, and a position to store it's position on the play field.

\subsubsection{Player}
The \emph{Player} is used to identify \emph{Simulation}s and \emph{Score}s in order to map them to a physical player.

\subsubsection{PlayField}
The \emph{PlayField} contains information about the physical play field on which a simulation takes place.

\subsubsection{Score}
The \emph{Score} keeps tracks of the points the \emph{Player} scored.

\subsubsection{Simulation}
A \emph{Simulation} is a self-contained process and consists a fixed amount of \emph{Game}s in which the \emph{Player} can achieve a \emph{Score}. 


\subsection{Relationships}

\subsubsection{Player plays Simulation}

\subsubsection{Score belongs to Player}

\subsubsection{Score during Simulation}

\subsubsection{Game belongs to Simulation}

\subsubsection{Simulations plays on PlayField}

\subsubsection{PlayField consists of Obstacle}

\subsubsection{Game has Ball}

%\subsubsection{Administrator administrates Doctor}

%The \texttt{Administrator} can have zero to n \texttt{Doctor}s he administrates in the system. In the initial state of the system, there is no \texttt{Doctor}. As the system should be able to handle a big amount of \texttt{Doctor}s, they are all related to the \texttt{Administrator} they were created by.
