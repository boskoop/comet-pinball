%\subsubsection{Administrator administrates Doctor}

%The \texttt{Administrator} can have zero to n \texttt{Doctor}s he administrates in the system. In the initial state of the system, there is no \texttt{Doctor}. As the system should be able to handle a big amount of \texttt{Doctor}s, they are all related to the \texttt{Administrator} they were created by.
