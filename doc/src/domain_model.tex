%\subsubsection{Administrator} 

5The \texttt{Administrator} has the attributes \texttt{mailAddress} and \texttt{password} which are used as credentials to authenticate against the system.

%\subsubsection{Administrator administrates Doctor}

%The \texttt{Administrator} can have zero to n \texttt{Doctor}s he administrates in the system. In the initial state of the system, there is no \texttt{Doctor}. As the system should be able to handle a big amount of \texttt{Doctor}s, they are all related to the \texttt{Administrator} they were created by.
